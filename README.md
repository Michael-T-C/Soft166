## Application fact sheet
The application that i have created, is a check system that will check the strength of the password entered by the user. As the user types their password into the text box on the application page, the system will start to generate a value of strength based off key factors, such as if the password contains uppercase letters it will have 'x' strength added, the same as if a special character is used then it will add 'y' to the strength value. 

On my web page there is a variety of information relating to the good practice while using a password, such as with the above factors that add strength to it, advising the user to remember good practice to achieve the best result from the password they test. My page also contains a about me page, which contains (mostly) computer based facts about myself, such as my history in programming and how to contact me.

Although there is numerous features throughout my webpage, here is five that i believe to be key!
